(a)	Describe:  What is difference between Multiple Regression and Logistic Regression? What circumstances might determine which to use? (10 points)

Multiple Regression: a way to model the linear relationship between one quantitative response variable and one or more predictor variables.
Circumstances: Multiple regression is best used when trying to combine many variables to get a result. Which variables are likely to predict crime? You would look at wealth, gender, location, education, etc.

Logistic Regression: Regression model that uses an exponential function of variables to estimate a response that is either 0 and 1.
Circumstances: regression is best when looking for a binary answer (yes or no, success or failure, etc). For example, does gender predict the probability of having an exercise induced chest pain? The answer would be yes or no


Data being used: Since my government client deals with healthcare, I will be using the Heart Disease Data Set

Logistic Regression
Objective: What is the probability of a male experiencing exercise induced angina (severe pain in the chest)?

1.	check structure of data
> head(data)

2.	Data’s actual heading was not added, so I will have to manually do it.
> colnames(data) <- c("age", "sex", "cp", "trestbps", "chol", "fbs", "restscg", "thalach", "exang", "oldpeak", "slope", "ca", "thal", "heart_disease")

3.	Look at data again to ensure the titles were added 

4.	To make “exang” easier to read, I will change 1 = “YES” and 0 = “NO”
> data[data$exang == 0,]$exang <- "NO"
> data[data$exang == 1,]$exang <- "YES"
> data$exang <- as.factor(data$exang)

5.	I want to check the data distribution between men and women when it comes to “exang”
•	There’s a fairly good distribution, though more men are having exercise induced angina than women

6.	Let’s do a logistic regression and summarize the output
> logistic_regression = glm(exang ~sex, data = data, family = "binomial")
> summary(logistic_regression)

Multiple Regression
Objective: How well does wealth predict crime?
Data: US Crime.

1.	Plot data and display it
> plot(uscrime$Wealth, uscrime$Crime)
> abline(linear_model, col="red", lwd=2)

2.	You can see a correlation, but doing a linear model will give a clear correlation
> linear_model <- lm(Crime ~ Wealth, data = uscrime)
> summary(linear_model)
•	R-Squared = 0.195, p-value = 0.001902 say that wealth does a good job of predicting crime

3.	For multiple regression, we will use wealth and education to predict crime.
> multiple_regression <- lm(Crime ~ Wealth + Ed, data = uscrime)
> summary(multiple_regression)
