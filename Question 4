1)	What is a component – Provide a description (5 points)
A component is the formation of a new variable caused by the combination of predictor variable. 

2)	Principal Component Analysis – Provide a description. (5 points)
PCA is the transformation of data into orthogonal dimensions that are ranked by variance. It combines variables into new variables to simplify subsequent analysis. Its goal is to maximize data variability with as few components as possible. The end goal is to retain as much information as possible, while reducing variables
Example: Wanting to find the variance between, crime, wealth, education, location, race, gender, etc.

> model <- lm(Crime~., data = uscrime)
> summary(model)
> uscrimex <- uscrime[1:15]
> uscrimex.PCA <- prcomp(uscrimex, scale = TRUE)
> summary(uscrimex.PCA)
> screeplot(uscrimex.PCA, type = "lines", npcs = 15)
